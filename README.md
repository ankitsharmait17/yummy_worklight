Yummy Mobile App
This is a cross-platform mobile app made with IBM Worklight. I couldn't upload all the files but it contains the overall design of the app and also the adapter. The database was made in IBM DB2. You can import it in Eclipse IDE with IBM Worklight.
This is app was made to make restaurant bookings with Google Maps functionality.
